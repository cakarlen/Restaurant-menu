        About our restaurant:
        <br>
          <blockquote>Big Foot's BBQ was founded in 1998 in Memphis by Mr. John Foot. Mr. Foot started the restaurant as
          a local BBQ restaurant with one goal in mind: creating the best BBQ in town. Soon after opening,
          Mr. Foot brought in family members to help maintain the restaurant after a huge opening day.
          In 2001, the Memphis location was relocated to allow more room for a bigger kitchen and dining room.
          Not soon after relocating, a second Big Foot's BBQ was opened in Nashville in 2003. With business now
          booming, both locations were remodeled in 2007. Big Foot's BBQ has now won Nashville's best BBQ and will
          continue to provide quality BBQ to the Memphis and Nashville area.
